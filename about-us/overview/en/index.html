      <h2 class="c-article__heading02">Reasons why philanthropic work and the establishment of Monphy and youth foundation.</h2>

      <p class="c-article__text">
        I ( MR.MONPHY ) have been recognized by my works as I have catered and supported for so many people in my communities. I have provided for their needs in terms of providing their educational needs by building schools, paying of school fees, giving financial support to the needy, paying of hospital bills, providing ambulances to some health care centers, giving employment to peoples as well as funding projects in the various communities like boreholes etc.
      </p>

      <p class="c-article__text">
        In 2006, when I visited Ghana with my Japanese wife and three of our children, some unacceptable incident happened which contributed to one of the reasons I established Monphy & The Youth Foundation.

        Our second child felt sick at night, so early morning we sent him to St.Theresa’s Hospital within Nkoranza township.<br>By 10am he was treated and discharged and as we were about to go. I saw a man and his son which the father was crying in pains, looking so exhausted and shouting for help. I inquired to know what was really happening to him and I found out that his child died instantly on arrival to the hospital. His son has been severely sick for so long a time and the sad aspect was that the father had no money to take him to hospital.<br>
        I probed the father further only to know he has resorted to herbal medicine as a cure to the son’s ailment which could not heal the child sickness and suffering and that was worsening his conditions.<br>
        Besides, he had no money for transportation and to pay for the hospital bills. But he was fortunate on that night to have a friend’s bicycle to send his son  to Nkoranza hospital which was about 40 kilometers by distance.

      <p class="c-article__text">
        I was so heartbroken, imagine how pitiful child struggled to death.<br>
        Ladies and gentlemen, my question to you is that can such a dreadful incident happened in Japan?. I wish could do every possible means to save the boy’s live but Unfortunately he died before his arrival. Even as the boy died the necessary process he had to go through at the hospital for autopsy and preservation was a problem for the man because it requires money of which he didn’t have.<br>
        The man had no one to look up to which he pleaded for me to come to his aid and I offered him my assistance.
      </p>

      <p class="c-article__text">
        Later on. I took a sober reflection upon all the scenarios of what I saw, the pains the son went through, the pains the father went through before and after the son died, and the pains I personally went through called for the need for me to start doing something visibly for my society.<br>
        After months of reflecting and deciding, I started the process to the establishment of the foundation.

      <p class="c-article__text">
        It's not an easy, devoting yourself to help others.<br>
        There are advantages and disadvantages in what humans do.<br>
        Some might love to push you up and it's what some people are offering us right now.

        I strongly had a feeling that I could not realize my dream somehow in a very short period of time. Peoples expectations are very high but my dream is to built a foundation that would provide every single child with formal education so that future generations could stand up for their rights.

        Africa has long way to free ourselves from slavery, poverty, teenage death, illness, high rate of illiterate, selfishness, corruption etc.<br>
        Ghana has many natural resources such gold, diamonds, timber, oil, cocoa, to mention but few.<br>
        why must we still remain in poverty?<br>
        Why no enough hospitals and schools?<br>
        Why must people still drink from contaminated river sources?<br>
        Why still poverty continues to grow?<br>
        Why our resources are being controlled by foreign companies?<br>
      </p>

      <p class="c-article__text">
        The only means to break this cycle of misfortune is through education, unity, cooperation and hardworking. This remains the major reason why I still count on your usual cooperation.
