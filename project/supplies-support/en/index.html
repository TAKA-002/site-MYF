          Currently Mrs.Kondo had donated about 5,000 pieces of cloths to our storage yard in Chiba which we’re working on it to ship to Ghana. We had also able to gathered about 300 pieces of school bags “RANDSULE“ from schools and individual including students of some elementary schools.<br>The event was organized by Mrs.Spencer and friends and Mrs.Saitou and family every year and a volunteer group from Nagoya. Although Some of the students wanted to keep their bags for future memories, but they gave up the idea, which inspired me a lot. I'm always moved and appreciate their kind cooperation and support to our tiny organization.<br>
          During the distribution of the school bags to Monphy Educational Complex students after it final destination to Ghana the students were jubilating and singing. We're poor, needy and powerless but you always energized us. Our mouths ask for blessings for you.

          "Yen nuanom yenye moden nie, moye buei. Yebeshia Dabi“..（Our brothers, sisters and donors, we express our warmhearted gratitude for your support. "See you soon in Japan." Since from 2010 ~ 2021 about 230 tone of donated items had been shipped to Ghana by loading in a 40ft container. We had distributed to over 135 villages around Nkoranza municipal. After distribution of items , one Kwadwo Boache a 9 years old orphan from Akrodwa at Nkoranza north, approached one of our staffs and said, Anytime Christmas is at corner, I have no one to turn to but thank God that I'm still alive. I will put on these donated cloths if Christmas comes. I thanks those who donated these clothes to us. I will also remember them in my prayers for good health and happiness.

          In 2015 two young Japanese university students who participated in voluntary work for Monphy & Youth foundation who wanted to experience the living lives of the village people. Soon After arriving in Ghana they started exploring their adventure. First we started sorting out donated items into three categories, woman's, mans and children's to paving way toward distributing to schools, the needed the poor and less endowed communities. People expressed their joy and appreciation for the wonderful gifts from Japan and continuously asked for more interventions to improve their living conditions.<br> 
          Heida san also donated total number of 80 unite of wheelchairs. It was warmhearted and amazing to see some Handicaps crawling on their knees from some distance while others were carried on the back by their relatives to the distribution site after the news was broken out. After the donation One mother said her child can now go to school while another also said he can now go out to pray with friends.

          I just want to tell everyone who's reading this post that it's not about the big amount you donate that counts. The little things you give out from your hearts are making huge impacts elsewhere.
