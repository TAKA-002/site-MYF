          Many individuals including Mrs.Kondo and some companies have been supporting and donating useful items such as new and second-hand clothes, Shoes, bags, some stationeries to Monphy And The Youth Foundation.<br />Among the things Mrs.Kondo have donated included 30 units brand new strollers
          "Baby Car" which were shipped to Ghana since January 2019. <br />The strollers were distributed to widows with babies, twin-babies, handicaps and single mothers.
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          One mother with twins said she found it difficult to handle both babies when eating or doing other chores but now with the stroller, it has made the handling of the babies easier for her. Another woman also said she returned from the kitchen and found a snake around her baby when the baby
          was left alone in the compound. She believes that the strollers will help her carry the baby with her wherever she goes.
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">Currently Mrs.Kondo had donated about 5,000 pieces of clothes to our storage yard in Chiba which we are working on to ship to Ghana.</p>

          We have also been able to gather about 300 pieces of school bags “RANDSULE“ from schools and individual including students of Yaguchi Elementary school, Tamagawa elementary school and Saitama elementary school.<br />
          The event was organized by Mrs Spencer and friends and Mrs.Saitou and family every year and a volunteer group from Nagoya.<br />Although Some of the students wanted to keep their bags for future memories, but they gave up the idea, which inspired me a lot.<br />I'm always moved and I
          appreciate their kind cooperation and support to our small organization.
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          During the distribution of the school bags to Monphy Educational Complex students after it final destination to Ghana the students were jubilating and singing….<br />We are poor, needy and powerless but you always motivate and energized us with your donations.<br />We pray and ask for
          God’s blessings on you.

          Since 2010~2021 about 230 tones of donated items have been shipped to Ghana by loading them in a 40ft container. We had distributed them to over 135 villages around Nkoranza municipal. After distribution of items, one Kwadwo Boachie, a 9 years old orphan from Akrodwa at Nkoranza north,
          approached one of our staff and said to him, Anytime it’s Christmas, I have no one to turn to for the provision of such items but thank God today I am living to be a beneficial from your philanthropist gesture. I will put on these donated clothes if Christmas comes. I thanks those who
          donated these clothes to us. I will also remember them in my prayers for good health and happiness always.

          In 2015 two young Japanese university students who participated in voluntary work for Monphy & Youth foundation who wanted to experience living in the village went to Ghana. Soon After arriving in Ghana they started exploring their adventure. First we started sorting out donated items into
          three categories, women, men and children and we started the distributions to schools. We distributed to the poor and less endowed students in communities. People expressed their joy and appreciation for the wonderful donations from Japan and continuously asked for more interventions to
          improve their living conditions.

          donations.After the donation One mother said her child can now go to school while another also said he can now go out to pray with friends.I just want to tell donors and supporters that it's not about the big amount you donate that counts but about the little you can offer, because no
          donations is too small.The little things you are giving out from your hearts are making huge impacts elsewhere and I would want to appeal to you all that together we can change lives...please Help!!!!!.

            Recently the government has built some public schools to eliminate children studying under trees and enable every child to gain better and free education.<br />
            Good education is the only way to save the African continent. There are Graduates such as Professors, PHD holders, Designers Architectures, Doctors and Engineers, but workers are often imported to build our roads, hospitals, Airports, Dams and etc.<br />
            Politicians and high net worth individuals send their children abroad to gain good education and knowledge, knowing that the education system they themselves implemented is not functioning properly in their own country.<br />
            When sick, they go to health checkups in Europe, America, South Africa and more recently in Dubai. The rich and politicians send their wives to deliver their babies outside Ghana when pregnant.<br />
            Quality life seems to be guaranteed only to the rich minority (about 1%). About 65% of the poor do not have the privilege of living meaningfully in Africa.
