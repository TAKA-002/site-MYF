        <p class="c-article__text">
          Out of the 30 villages, Monphy & Youth NGO have been able to provide them with only 5 boreholes which is so inadequate to meet the quest of water in those villages.
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          Prior to these borehole projects, children used to fetch water from streams and other polluted water bodies far away from home. As a result, there were cases of disease outbreak such as diarrhea and some water related diseases especially among children in the villages. In addition, children’s education was interrupted by the long distances covered to fetch water early in the morning. In some instances, cases of snakebite were recorded out of which some children lost their lives.<br>
          The borehole construction has significantly reduced such water related illness and effectively enhanced quality education since children can go to school early in the morning.

          Secondly, the wells provide water for school lunches, unlike other places where students have no choice but to bring water from their homes or nearby streams and rivers. The boreholes had given a glimpse into the bright future of our children. Scarcity of water is a major problem in Ghana as a significant percentage of Ghana’s population have little or no water supply and the causes and effects are so glaring for everyone to see of which the Nkoranza Municipality is of no exception.<br>
          However, Monphy and Youth foundation are taking steps in addressing this situations in order to reduce the dangers of lack of water provision among the Ghanaian populace especially within Nkoranza a and it’s environs. Among the steps taken are the boreholes we dug at Monphy Educational Complex which was a timely intervention and has been very useful to the students Since the outbreak of Corona virus in 2020. The staff and teachers of the school did ensured all protocols were duly observed because there were available potable water and that include the washing of hands regularly and within time, etc. and that have made parents visiting the school happy with the provision of water and measures put in Place. I must say the boreholes are not only serving the school but also Farmers around the school who fetch water to keep their farms growing instead of carrying water from long distances from their homes.

        <p class="c-article__text">
          There are over 30 schools around the villages without good drinking water or boreholes which have led or forced them to drink from contaminated rivers with animals such as goats, sheep and cattle predominantly during dry seasons and the rivers becoming muddy as a results of the rains when there are erosions. The sad aspect is that, mostly in the harmattan season when water bodies are dried up, children have to walk miles to the big rivers before they can fetch water and you can imagine what students and old women go through before they can get water for their household chores. Currently, one borehole is estimated to cost about ¥300,000 and is the desire or aim of this organization to drill more boreholes to help alleviate the suffering students and community members from the plight they are going through. It is because of this appalling situation that the organization is appealing to you, companies and General public that you should all come on board to do all you can within your abilities to help provide for them boreholes which will help save these children and the entire community from their water problems by preventing them from later hours from school, drinking of polluted or contaminated waters and to save them from diseases and other infections.

          In Ghana, the poor farmers children daily’s work is to go and fetch water from the river side twice in the morning and twice after school. On Sundays and Saturdays too they accompany their parents to the farms in support of that. Besides, the Sanitation system unlike that of Japan and other parts of the world are also very poor leading to pollution of the water bodies and they are the same waters they drink from. It’s my vision and mission that every village have one borehole to help limit the time spent by students and women in search of water. By limiting the time will enable children to have enough time for their books by studying and do their home-works or assignments, and will make women have enough time also by doing other chores and having time to check on their children. The organization is willing to provide more but we don’t have the financial capacity and support in meeting these quests.
