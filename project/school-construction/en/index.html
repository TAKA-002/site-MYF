        <p class="c-article__text">
          Most Ghanaian children are unable to access basic education despite the numerous government interventions and yet many children in Ghana have been denied Quality Primary Education. Most teachers complain of lack of teaching and learning materials, especially textbooks, workbooks, computers and supplementary readers has setbacks for Quality Primary Education. Head Teachers and parents of Pupils Primary Schools argued that textbooks and supplementary readers are the only tools available for most Ghanaian children to acquire knowledge and skills, It is in view of this that our organization (Monphy & Youth foundation) started construction of educational facilities classrooms Blocks, toilet, and playing grounds etc to provide better quality education to help raise the falling standards of education for the Orphans, Physically Challenged and the Less-Privileged Children in our society at Nkoranza, Bono East Region of Ghana.

Currently the student population has increased from 65 to 450 students during admissions from 2016 September 20th to 2021 February.<br>

          Our purpose for constructing better schools with better education is to help reduce poverty in Ghana and the entire Africa by providing skilled oriented education to the present generation. Recently the government has built some public schools to eliminate children studying under trees and enable every child to gain better and free education. Good education is the only way to save the African continent.

        <p class="c-article__text">
          There are Graduates such as Professors, PHD holders, Designers Architectures, Doctors and Engineers, but workers are often imported to build our roads, hospitals, Airports, Dams and etc. Politicians and high net worth individuals send their children abroad to gain good education and knowledge, knowing that the education system they themselves implemented is not functioning properly in their own country. When sick, they go to health checkups in Europe, America, South Africa and more recently in Dubai. The rich and politicians send their wives to deliver their babies outside Ghana when pregnant. <br>
          Quality life seems to be guaranteed only to the rich minority (about 1%).<br>
          About 65% of the poor do not have the privilege of living meaningfully in Africa. System inequality causing human security problems.

          I wish and hope that such an unfortunate phenomenon will stop immediately to ensure equality education, justice and equal opportunity for all.
          This is the reason why I am taking these steps with the foundation to make sure my desires and hopes come to fruition.

            It came to bare that, the lack of proper toilet facilities in the school is impacting negatively on their academic works and hampering proper sanitation measures. In 2019, the organization started the construction of a three story building of which the first floor is to be used for toilet purposes and the second floor will Serve as a library and third floor will be an ICT center. It was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021 but as it is now, it’s still not completed due to lack of funds.
