          Most Ghanaian children are unable to access basic education despite the numerous government interventions and yet many children in Ghana have been denied Quality Primary Education. Most teachers complain of lack of teaching and learning materials, especially textbooks, workbooks, computers and supplementary readers has setbacks for Quality Primary Education. Head Teachers and parents of Pupils Primary Schools argued that textbooks and supplementary readers are the only tools available for most Ghanaian children to acquire knowledge and skills, It is in view of this that our organization (Monphy & Youth foundation) started construction of educational facilities classrooms Blocks, toilet, and playing grounds etc to provide better quality education to help raise the falling standards of education for the Orphans, Physically Challenged and the Less-Privileged Children in our society at Nkoranza, Bono East Region of Ghana.

            Construction started 2011 and the school was opened on 2016 September 20th whilst it was still under constructions. Fortunately Uncompleted portion was completed in 2019. Currently the student population has increased from 65 to 450 students during admissions from 2016 September 20th to 2021 February.<br>We aim to provide quality education for relatively quality life for future generations.

        <p class="c-article__text">
          Our purpose for constructing better schools with better education is to help reduce poverty in Ghana and the entire Africa by providing skilled oriented education to the present generation. Recently the government has built some public schools to eliminate children studying under trees and enable every child to gain better and free education. Good education is the only way to save the African continent. There are Graduates such as Professors, PHD holders, Designers Architectures, Doctors and Engineers, but workers are often imported to build our roads, hospitals, Airports, Dams and etc. Politicians and high net worth individuals send their children abroad to gain good education and knowledge, knowing that the education system they themselves implemented is not functioning properly in their own country. When sick, they go to health checkups in Europe, America, South Africa and more recently in Dubai. The rich and politicians send their wives to deliver their babies outside Ghana when pregnant. Quality life seems to be guaranteed only to the rich minority (about 1%). About 65% of the poor do not have the privilege of living meaningfully in Africa. System inequality causing human security problems. I wish and hope that such an unfortunate phenomenon will stop immediately to ensure equality education, justice and equal opportunity for all.
          This is the reason why I am taking these steps with the foundation to make sure my desires and hopes come to fruition.

          Monphy and Youth foundation a non governmental organization With a primary objective of ensuring every child of school going age have a basic education is raising funds to establish  an educational complex within the nkoranza Municipality. Being it an educational complex requires to have all basic facilities and that include a place of convenience (toilet facility). It came to bare that, the lack of proper toilet facilities in the school is impacting negatively on their academic works and hampering proper sanitation measures. In 2019, the organization started the construction of a three story building of which the first floor is to be used for toilet purposes and the second floor will Serve as a library and third floor will be an ICT center. It was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021 but as it is now, it’s still not completed due to lack of funds. This toilet block will serve more than 500 students with both teaching and non-teaching staff, not only will this project keep the children and teachers safe and healthy, but will begin to educate them on better sanitation practices, keeping future generations safe and healthy as well. However, time is running out as our  expectations could not be achieved due to slow pace of the construction. Again, we are appealing to you by helping us through your contributions and it will not only allows for the construction of the proposed toilet block, but also employs local workers in managing it and your contribution will ensure that students in this school will be better protected from disease and will begin educating the children and their parents on safe hygiene practices. Ultimately, your contribution will change lives. The total cost for these facilities (toilet, library and ICT center is estimated to cost about ¥6,500,000 and that will include equipping or furnishing them. Although, it is widely known that the corona-virus has brought hardships economically and has affected every businesses but still we want to encourage you that your name will be added to the contributors list. Thank You.
