          The National ambulance service of Ghana as established by the government of Ghana has a core mandate of providing efficient and timely pre-hospital emergency medical care to the sick and the injured and to transport them safely to the health facilities.<br>
          But to the rural areas or the villages where their services are mostly needed are virtually unavailable. This has made accessing health facilities in case of emergencies extremely difficult.<br>
          Looking at the situation at which people especially Pregnant women and the aged, were dying on their way to far-away hospitals, it was heartbreaking.<br>
          Monphy and Youth foundation took it upon themselves to help secured ambulances to these villages and we made a passionate appeal to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government which they gave to us TWO ambulances and some hospital materials of which we shipped them to Ghana. 
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          The organization distributed them to Nkoranzaman Health Center and Regional Hospital at Sunyani, both in Bono Region, as these hospitals had no Ambulances. <br>
          These ambulances after they have been donated are serving the communities very well, as they transport emergency cases of children, pregnant women and accident victims whose conditions are critical to teaching hospitals better equipped with medical experts in the big cities.<br>
          The director at the Sunyani Regional hospital have been praising us that the ambulances came in at the right time as the hospital was in dire need of it because the one the hospital have was broken down.<br>
          He further said that, during emergency cases they  have to rent a car to transport patients to the bigger hospitals and that comes with a cost on the hospital or the poor patients and they even die because there are no paramedics to monitor them whilst being taken away, and with the ones we have donated is going to save more lives and improve healthcare delivery within the region.
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          We are so much happy and encouraged by the confessions of the Regional director that our efforts are yielding positive results in achieving our aims or objectives as an organization.<br>
          Later on, we are still receiving calls and praises from the communities that these ambulances are serving their intended purposes as some recovered patients are thanking all who put in efforts for them to have the ambulances and indeed they are asking for more.

          (NHIS) is a social intervention program introduced by government of Ghana to provide financial access and quality health care for residents of which one has to pay a premium before he can be enrolled onto the scheme.<br>
          After it’s introduction it’s has not been able to cover Majority of Ghanaians especially among those in the rural areas.<br>
          Despite the implementation of the scheme it is still faced with many challenges with regards to people enrolling on, among residents in the Nkoranza Municipality due to Financial difficulties.
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          As part of Monphy & Youth foundation’s (NGO) social responsibilities, have been able to provide to 621 residents with free health insurance cards by paying for their premium as they are now enrolled onto the health insurance scheme from 2011~2020. <br>
          They were picked randomly through interviews by our staff(s) including opinion leaders in the villages to ascertain those who really need the cards but cannot afford to pay. <br>
          We sometimes have to travelled 30~40kilometers through poor roads to reach our destination. <br>
          Before going to the villages we send some members of our team to notify the sub-chiefs, elders and government representatives for approval. <br>
          When we started our screening we found out that some children and adults have fallen sick for many days and months without seeking medical attention and they are left to their fate without any proper health care and they are kept indoors.<br>
          The reasons they gave us after we asked them why they are not attending to any hospital was that they don’t have Health Insurance cards and cannot afford to pay for their health bills and for some who have had theirs expired cannot renew it.<br>
          Some parents had even left their sick children in their rooms and had gone to farm. It was an eyesore to see some sick children going through excruciating pains and it was a sad and worrying situation.<br>
          Conversely, the Registration fees for the Insurance for a minor is between ¥500 and ¥1,000 for adults.<br>
          Most of the sick children and adults we met had their conditions worsened on that day and we found every possible means to take them to hospital but because it was too late, some of them ended up losing their lives. <br>
          That was so heartbreaking and as part of the goals and missions of Our foundation to help save lives, we are charged to do more on our works to achieve such goals in the years ahead and we cannot do it alone without your support or assistance, and with your support we can detect some diseases with regular health checks for the people by visiting the hospital with their cards and to prevent some premature deaths especially among the youths. 
        </p>

        <p class="c-article__text">
          Together we can all save lives..<br>
          Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.<br>
          We are still counting on you.
